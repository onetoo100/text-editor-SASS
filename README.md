# text-editor-SASS
Created a simple responsive text editor with SASS
You can change words, make it bold, italic, add underline, capitalization and add paragraphs.
	
Why the project is useful

	- how to use JS commands to change content text
	- how to implement upper and lower case in a part of text
	- how to implement paragraphs

Important concepts I used:

	- document.execCommand();
